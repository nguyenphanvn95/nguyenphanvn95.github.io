        "englishText": "The table compares four different energy sources in terms of their cost, efficiency and environmental impact. Coal is shown to be the cheapest option but also the least efficient and most polluting. Solar power, by contrast, is the most expensive but has the highest efficiency and lowest environmental impact. Natural gas and nuclear power fall somewhere in between these two extremes."
