        "englishText": "Some people argue that university education is no longer necessary in today's world. However, I strongly believe that higher education still provides significant benefits. Firstly, it equips students with specialized knowledge and skills that are valuable in the job market. Secondly, university is a place where students develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Finally, the social networks formed during university years can be invaluable for future career opportunities."

        "englishText": "Globalization has brought about profound changes to societies around the world. On the positive side, it has facilitated cultural exchange and economic growth. However, critics argue that it has also led to the erosion of local traditions and increased inequality. In my view, while globalization is inevitable, governments should implement policies to mitigate its negative effects and ensure that its benefits are distributed more equitably."
